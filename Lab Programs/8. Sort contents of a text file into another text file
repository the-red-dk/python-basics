'''6. Develop a program to sort the contents of a text file and write the sorted contents
into a separate text file. [Hint: Use string methods strip(), len(),
list methods sort(), append(), and file methods open(), readlines(), and write()].'''


file = open('text.txt')
out  = open('result.txt', 'w')

words = []

for line in file.readlines():
    line = line.strip().split()

    for i in line:

        for i in words:
            out.write(i)
            out.write('\n')
